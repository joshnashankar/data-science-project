Project Title: Analysing the Factors Influencing Pricing in Budget-Friendly Electric Vehicles.
Research Question: What are the key factors influencing the price of the most affordable electric cars, 
                   and how do these factors vary across different models and manufacturers?
Project Objective: This project's goal is to use machine learning techniques to examine the elements
                  that affect the cost of reasonably priced electric automobiles. The research intends
                  to give manufacturers and policymakers information to enhance EV affordability and 
                  encourage wider adoption by comprehending how elements like battery range, charging 
                  time, and brand impact pricing.
